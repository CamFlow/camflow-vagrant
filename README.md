# Vagrant Script for CamFlow

Vagrant script for quick demo VM setup.

## Installation

In order to run the vagrant image you first need to install the following three softwares:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

Download the version corresponding to your OS and architecture (e.g. Windows x64).

On Ubuntu simply:
